# My Technical Writing Portfolio

This repository contains samples of my work as a technical writer. Because most of this content was created as PDFs drawn from content published on corporate websites, formatting problems reflect CSS issues in the published content, rather than intentional formatting in the source. 

I wrote the primary text in these documents with input from technical and product sources and from peer reviewers. Where possible, they also reflect my own testing of product functionality. They're not rewrites of documents contributed by other people. 

## Index of Samples

This repository contains a collection of files demonstrating a range of skills and technical expertise. 

### [guide-to-documentation-voice-and-tone.pdf](/guide-to-documentation-voice-and-tone.pdf)

As a primary creator of Xandr's documentation style guide, I contributed these guidelines and examples, which were used by the User Experience team as well as Technical Communication team.

### [guide-to-understanding-report-discrepancies.pdf](guide-to-understanding-report-discrepancies.pdf)

At the request of Technical Support, this guide was created to deflect cases based on user misunderstanding of how reports work. It also provides steps and guidelines for documenting a legitimate discrepancy in reported statistics.  

### [selecting-ad-quality-rules.pdf](selecting-ad-quality-rules.pdf)

This topic was created as part of a "tactical documentation" initiative, in collaboration with Technical Support, to supplement reference documentation describing a complex UI. It provides a problem/solution approach to help customers understand how to apply rules-based configuration to typical challenges advertisers experience.  

### [set-up-a-line-item-using-api.pdf](set-up-a-line-item-using-api.pdf)

I created this guide to supplement the extensive API reference documentation for ad campaign line items with end-to-end workflow instructions and examples. 

### [setting-up-express-analysis.pdf](setting-up-express-analysis.pdf)

Express Analysis, the feature described here, was initially a SaaS-only feature configured by Professional Services and unavailable to on-premise customers. I created this guide, as well as an annotated configuration file, to enable self-service configuration for administrators.
